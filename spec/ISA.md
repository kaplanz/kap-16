# Specification

## LANv1

LANv1, short for **L**ite **A**ssembly **N**otation (**v**ersion **1**), is KAP-16's instruction set.
As a RISC "loadâ€“store" architecture, the [`LDR`](./inst/LDR.md) and [`STR`](./inst/STR.md) instructions (along with their pseudo-instructions) are the sole interface to memory; all other instructions perform operations between registers.
The ISA is inspired by ARM, but the notation does differ in several places.

### Instructions

Due to the constraints of 16-bit instruction registers, KAP-16 uses an interesting instruction opcode format:
Instead of a traditional fixed-width opcode, [Huffman codings][huffman-codings] were used to design a variable-width opcode format.
Read about it [here](../doc/huffman/README.md) for further details.

### Condition Codes

Several instructions modify the status register's condition code flags as a result of their operation.
The following table provides a quick reference to how instructions interact with condition codes.

### Immediates

Most instructions allow the final operand to, instead of a register, be supplied as immediate data.
Additionally, immediate data may be either sign extended if specified by the instruction.
The following table outlines the immediate data various instructions accept.

### Notation

Each LANv1 instruction has 0-2 operands, with the final operand usually allowing for 7-bit immediate data instead of a register.
For detailed information on an instruction, refer to its manual page in [`inst/`](./inst).

General guidelines are as follows:
- All registers may be referred to by either their index (`Rx`), or their alias (e.g. `PC`).
- Operands are to be separated by a single comma (`,`).
- Extra whitespace is ignored by the assembler, so feel free to align instructions as you see fit.
- Literal integer constants **must** specify their radix using one of the following prefixes:
  - Binary: `0b`
  - Octal: `0o`
  - Decimal: `0d`
  - Hexadecimal: `0x`
- Whenever interfacing with memory, use C-style pointer notation:
  - A [load](./inst/LDR.md) must dereference an address with `*`.
  - A [store](./inst/STR.md) must resolve an address with `&`.
